This is the group project when I took NIU CSCI680 Human-Computer Interaction.

Project 1 is about comparing the information between two tables.
project 2 is about comparing the movie network and show the movie information when different movie have similarity.

During this course, I try to fix the problem, and achieve the goal by using html,css,javaScript. 

The website may not professional, but we achieved the requirements.
